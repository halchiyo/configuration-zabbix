# Configuration Management

## Introduction
The goal of the ***/configuration-zabbix project is to provide a simple, but flexible, way for zabbix configuration.

This is managed by [Ansible](http://ansible.com/).
We have provided a number of playbooks that will configure each of the Zabbix Components.

* Zabbix Server and WEB Interface (Not Yet)
* Zabbix Proxy (Not Yet)
* Zabbix Agent
